              "'Under Income Tax, all medical related deductions to be clubbed with a much higher overall limit. House Rent Income and interest expense to be treated separately in the existing section. The deductions and exemptions related to Housing for Individuals are spread across many sections with varying limits. All deductions related to self-occupied housing - either owned or rented - should ideally be clubbed into a single Section with a higher limit to avoid discrimination based on nomenclature of earning / expense. Increase education spending So the government should not go on changing the fitment factor of central government staff salary and increase the salary of high salary earners in the Government, in the hope these people will drive consumption by purchasing more cars, house etc, which is completely wrong, making a few people more wealthy by increasing their salary for no valid reasons in the hope of creating demand in the economy is poor economics. Salaried people are the ones who bear a major chunk of tax burden of the country as they can’t claim any kind of loss as in case of business income class. Sir please invest in new innovations, invention, technology and etc. With the pandemic prevailing since past 2 years, and we moving more into digital space and aggressively promoting digitalization, I see India will heavily need mental health infrastructure as I see a lot of people suffering from brain hemorrhage, migraine, depression, and many other such mental health issue. 15) Legislation should be enacted to ensure that cell phone companies do not act against the government at any time 16) Steps should be taken to phase out cash flow in paper form 17) The intangible assets must be linked to the aadhar number 18) Its current status should be updated once a year in schools and higher education. 19) Heritage sites, temples and towns should be rehabilitated to promote tourism 20) The methods of investigation and punishment for bribery and corruption should be very strict 21) Industries should be decentralized to prevent them from accumulating in a few parts of the country and a few parts of the state 22) Solid waste and liquid waste management should be carried o Mere passing an UPSC exam, interview and a year of training is not enough for IAS to occupy important positions in the organisations. Budget should effectively friendly for all. All our policies were optimally framed, but implementation part is always been put aside. So please put resources on implementation. If salary need to be increased for central government employees it should be limited only to the lowest grade. 7th Pay commission which implemented fitment of 2.53 for people who were earning salary 1 Lakh/month increased to 2.53 lakhs/month was totally wrong. No one need 2 lakhs /month salary in govt , which is extremely on higher side and caused the tax payer huge amount , but not much for the economy as the high pay takers can take 1 or 2 cars and 1 or 2 flats, if the same 2 lakh salary was instead paid to 8 people with salary of 25000 each would buy 1 car & 1 flat I kindly request the Government to make all of it\\'s digital presence including all websites to be accessibility compliant as per the WCAG guidelines with immediate effect to strongly boost the digital India mission in hand with the Accessible India campaign Tax holiday for 1 year for real estate/automobile purchases. It is a great achievement by the Government. A base tax rate + a surcharge + a cess makes it very difficult for taxpayers to compute and pay. This rationalisation will be very helpful while doing computations. Else it creates a cash flow difficulty to the supplier esp. There is still one issue government should take steps to make sure the benefits reach to intended person. Well as we all know that union budget 2022-2023 is on its way and there might be a huge fall in stock market as well because of new changes in tax reforms.by increase in taxes on clothing industry that it might be on purpose but it may have an negative impact on trade because lot of people may not find it convenient for people owing wholesaler and retailer market and consumer too. It is high time that such salaried class people who have no option but to pay income tax, are given substantial benefits in forthcoming budget. The budget should highlight the benefits for taxpayers and non-payers, because the funds provided by tax payers are distributed among all the citizens of the country. Aadhar card should be made mandatory to get bank accounts, vehicles, property, and other essential items which will help to track the transactions of all individuals. BUDGET IDEAS FOR FY 2022-2023 My sincere thanks to our PM and FM for the initiatives for the welfare of Senior Citizens. Bring back Senior Citizen Concessions in Railway Tickets. Rate of Interest in Senior Citizen Savings Scheme and other such schemes may be fixed at 8% Per Annum. Those individuals who earn an income upto ₹500000 are not required to pay any tax. However, those who earn ₹500001 are required to pay a tax. And that tax is much higher than the increase in the income over ₹500000. There is no marginal relief to these taxpayers, like the one being available for surcharge and cess. The current salaried class pays 30 percent tax while corporates pay 22 percent tax. Request help for the following: 1) Increasing the limit for VPF to be saved for salaried employees 2) Increase of limit of PF+VPF+NPS for employer contribution beyond 7,50,000 3) Increase limit of PPF 4) Please help reduce the insurance burden on salaried class by helping provide us with the option to opt for PM Ayushman scheme for insurance DEAR SIR, SME ARE NOT GOING WELL AND THIS FINANCIAL YEAR WE HAVE EXPORTED MORE AND IMPORT ALSO INCREASING THIS IS DUE TO COMPETITOR WHATS TO INDIAN PRODUCT MUST BE MORE EXPENSIVE IN FOREIGN MARKET BECAUSE THERE IS AN DEMAND FOR MORE INDIAN GOODS AS OF NOW AS COMPARED TO COMPETITOR GOODS AND SERVICES. FIRST IN SHORT TERM WE ARE THE GAINERS AND WHEN OUR GOODS AND SERVICES ONCE COSTER IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET THEN THE COMPANY WHICH ARE EXPANDING FOR THERE GOODS AND SERVICES THERE WILL BE NO DEMANDS AS WE ARE IMPORTING FOR BECAUSE WE NEED TO EXPORT FASTER DUE TO DEMAND IN INTERNATIONAL MARKET EXCLUDING THE DOMESTIC MARKET. WE NEED TO FOCUS ON INDIAN MARKET & MAKE THEM STRONGER ELSE IN LONG RUN WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOSER THEN COMPETITOR WILL BE TAKE AN ADVANTAGE. Pension and Health Insurance Who pay more than Rs 100000 TAX in year they should be liable for pension and health insurance which is provided by government. While the idea is welcome, it is causing a large bit of procedural hassle for the payers as well as the earners. Those who earn higher amts can pay advance tax. Suggestions Pertaining to Persons with Disabilities for Consideration of the Government of India for Union Budget 2022-23 by A S Narayanan As per the IT Act, all the pensions are salaries, for the tax purpose. If both the pensions are income for the tax purpose, they why are there two different standard deductions. It is a good tool for retention and avoiding labour union troubles and can be used in PSUs effectively, if taxed liberally. Related to Apprenticeship Programme we have following suggestions to be incorporated in Budget . 1)The financial incentive presently given to the industry/ establishment. 2) Mandatory insurance of Weapon, Licence Holder as well as injured person in case of Issuance of Arms Licence either new or renewal. Insurance premium must be much high so that out of reach of layman. 5) Introduction of new tax - migration tax or brain drain tax to be levied on NRI as well as residents living outside India having dependents living in India or Having any link (property/substantial intrest) in India or any person who leaves India for job/education or any purpose for more than 180days. The idea of taxing the interest on PF contribution above a particular amount has been introduced recently. This will avoid a lot of mis-interpretations happening over this, creating wrong impression. I appreciate the current start-up ecosystem of India, but many start-ups are registering thier start-ups in other countries like Singapore,USA etc.. because, in india registering a start-up in India takes a month which includes 13 steps whereas in Singapore it takes on 2-3 days. In other countries like mentioned above, they give many TAX incentives to attract new start-ups and unicorns. The need for this scheme based on the lines of MGNREGA has also been observed by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Labour in August 2021. Related to Apprenticeship Programme we have following suggestions to be incorporated in Budget. Subject- Increase 80C limit under IT act or bring some new avenues to save taxes for salaried class individual. Sir, as everyone know there are very less avenues for salaried class individual to save income taxes. So pls increase the limit for investment in 80C of IT act. Ultimate purpose is to put a less Burden on existing tax payers. Please focus on widening Tax Base rather than on existing tax payers. Current Tax slab wouldn’t help middle class population. Please reduce the tax burden. We would like to use the Courier Shipping bill (CSB-V) method for faster clearance and saving clearance costs which are both important for the growing ecommerce industry. 2.issuing receipt to the consumer who pays GST.

For the Kind Attention of PM, FM, IT Department, Bankers and Chartered Accountants One Ledger for Income Tax accounting.

E.G: A ONE CADER OF PHARMACIST, AS PER 7TH CPC GOV. All medical expenses should be covered within from OPD to Surgeries under Medical Insurance. Haryana Government has LTC scheme for its pensioners above the age of 70 yrs under which amount equal to one month pension is paid per year. 2.Interest rate on Senior Citizen Saving Scheme be fixed at 8.5 so that those who want to park their hard earned money in this scheme get resealable assured income in growing old age.

If somehow, Password is forgotten or Account is Locked (being Dormant), to reset or unlock from such situation, the Account holder needs to have ATM/Debit Card along with PIN. For many Account holders, they don\\'t have ATM/Debit Card. The reason being either when they had opened their accounts esp. until 1990s, ATM/Debit Cards were not issued, or many don\\'t opt for Debit/ATM Card while opening their accounts. To resolve this situation, the only option for the customer is to visit the Home Branch and apply for the ATM/Debit Card. Some are even able to issue Virtual Debit/ATM Card. We (“ESOP Direct”) are a leading consulting company in the field of ESOPs since 1999.

By investing more in the health sector, health care needs to be made better and more conducive to every equal person. In the Union Budget, there should be further budgetary increase by the government in the basic sectors of defense, education, health and agriculture. But without that, we can do much more in defense, health, education and agriculture Inflation is going high ,people loose jobs hence if you are able to give some discount in direct tax that will be benefit all middle class and Sr citizens those are pension holders.

Water Credits - Water Conservation Drive by giving Economic Incentive [On the lines of Carbon Credits] Ministry/Department: Ministry of Jal Shakti The Idea: Just like Carbon Credits, we can develop a program where every household is allocated a number of water gallons usage. Anything the household saves in terms of Water usage can be used to get various govt. Background: Water credits have been in discussion for some time and in some water-stressed regions like California, Dr. Newsha Ajami has suggested how water credits can be used to incentivize water conservation and pollution reduction.

Kindly consider if it is good. Taxpayer is kept completely powerless on how his tax money will be utilized by the government, i.e. This will also boost on ground performance standards of services provided by government departments, as common man will now be empowered towards allocation of his tax money to such departments thus reducing the casual “Sarkari Babu” behaviour. Would like to suggest to bring 100% insurance of Bank deposits at a premium with a voluntary option to opt to insure with a premium or not by deposit holders 1% Tax payers out of 140 crores population in India is absurd.

Namste!, Pension to retired employees is a major recurring expenditure with 2 components: Basic Pension and Dearness (DA) + Medical Allowance. So DA need not be Paid to NRI Pensioners.

IT ceiling limit to be enhanced to 8 lakhs as in case of creamy layer. Limit on leave encashment of employees on retirement to be at par with government employees. Budget is a calculation of expenditure and income in financial year. 6 Human tax should be imposed for spiritual development of society.a fix amount should be charged for this. the union budget is required to plan the limited resources for the maximum benefit of the country. Furthermore, adequate earnings are required to be able to deploy resources in the country\\'s best interests. Last year on 17th December the chief minister advisor- KV Subramanian resigned from his position, which is why the same is now handled by CEA. And the replacement of the chief minister Advisor is yet to be decided by the government.Article 112 of the Constitution of India gives words about the union budget. Bring stringent law to ensure whatever budget allocation, planning is more effective. Provide good infrastructure.No permission required to prosecute Officers under corruption charges.Cases to be decided within 2 years. All the hospitals, Law firms, Private Tuition Teachers who earn their living must earn digitally only. Even the poor people have RUPAY card so it will be easy for them to transfer the money safely. The present medical insurance agencies shy away from providing coverage for treatment of existing serious illness or charge exorbitant rates for coverage. Government should consider providing medical insurance to all citizens at reasonable and affordable premium. Honble CM of Odisha had earlier demanded a NIFTEM for Odisha in Year 2017. GST Officers are thinking that all van sale traders are law evaders and imposing heavy penalty on the presumption of multiple sales,with the same gst invoices.

The act speaks as under for non government employees i.e. Cheap fuel,solar,cultivation of agriculture land . Export Statilite and defence equipment to gain huge FDI and revenue. Govt should utilize the citizens money in health, education,and infrastructure, agriculture, industry to generate more jobs for youth and increase their spending power Indians should have more investor friendly, so attract more investment and latest technology. Remove the long term gain tax as this amount is crucial for working class in case of emergencies or major transactions. Respected FM, I will like to draw your attention to Sanskrit language as the percentage of Sanskrit is only 0.0019 8% of India total population of 121 crore. Hence depositors are losing money. For example those in the 50s who are planning their retirement will have to pay tax for the entire interest income as they are already in the tax bracket. It may be noted that the amount saved is the money left after paying tax for the income at the rate up to 30%. In fact it is very cruel doing so. Disaster Insurance: India incurs huge economic loss due to disasters year on year. Why don\\'t we have appropriate disaster insurance for effective risk transfer and reduce the burden on public finance. We are losing a lot of money in the form of DA revision to Central and Satte governments. As the age increases, tax rate may be relaxed with provisions. (Off course for few cases provisions are available for critical diseases). - Export Doctors to foreign countries. Eg: Kerala State exported Nurses in the last 45 years and made rich NRI money. Since many retail investors depend on this money during this pandemic times. So kindly do the needful 1 Increase the limit of it section 80C to 5 lacks permitting PPF contribution of 3 kaca per person per annum.This shall give stable corpus to gov.and help youth to have habits of saving. 2 The long term capital gain on sale of house property to be abolished if property is inherited a d is more then 75 years old.

The Union Budget of India, also referred to as the Annual Financial Statement in Article 112 of the Constitution of India,[1] is the annual budget of the Republic of India. The Government presents it on the first day of February so that it could be materialised before the beginning of new financial year in April. While a \\'Vote on Account\\' deals only with the expenditure side of the government\\'s budget. While the law does not disqualify the Union govt. Ministry of Defense Defence only, no need for other treasury cosidering his time he shall be given vip treatmen in all sector of govt offices such as getting pasport , tickets polic station civil and city offices etc. Tamilnadu Government not giving information to my all petitions under right to information act petitions I am sacrifice my life to India government development I am workday in some private public organisation.

In our village, some people those who are under poverty line (i.e mostly there are under widow pension scheme ) struggling to top-up their plans every month. 2) People below poverty line can be given 6 (Six) LPG cylinders per year at a very nominal cost. Required raw materials can be supplied on priority. 4) Pregnant women can be given a financial assistance of ₹1000/per month upto one year after delivery of child. Similarly, illegal transport of minerals from one state to another , particularly without necessary permits, GST bills need to be curbed effectively. 2 Introduce Inheritance tax on all movable and immovable properties@0.5% on Govt value/ notional value on the day these assets are transferred in heirs name.If done in joint names then it will be on pro rata. Many more implimentable ideas PMGKY tax earning must be parked in exclusive corpus to be used for paying difference in MSP/ Mkt Price, directly in farmers Bank A/C Scrap income tax and introduce expenditure tax. Politicians salary and pension must be limited to non gazetted officers. Govt.jobs must be limited to maximum 15 years. All kind of reservation must be stopped. Cast and religious reservation must be stopped. Judicial officers should not be given any posting after retirement. Research/innovation is needed to devise unmatched body-amours, support tools, weapons and AFVs suitable for mountainous terrains. At the same time, considering the advanced stage India has achieved in Space Technology and the terrain India has to defend at the frontiers, India can develop a formidable Theatre Missile Defence System, in collaboration with France if needed. For many years it is capped at 1.5 Lakhs Make earnings per year as 12 lakhs, so that people spend more than pay taxes. the more they spend, the more there will be liquid cash in the market. This can be done by selling petrol to sub Audi mercides car at higher prices while smaller cars at lower prices since bigger cars are not eco-friendly fuel efficient. Similarly annual wealthy tax should be imposed on imporetd cars SUVs audi Mercedes etc since rich don\\'t bother to pay small amounts for their pride and prestige and Rs.1.5 lacs is too small amount for this. This would also ensure good amount of savings for our retirement, especially for the private sector employees where there is no provision of pension & medical coverage after retirement. Taxes on tobacco cigarette bidis should be increased 300% these products are responsible for lot of deaths. Kindly make a law by which this income is not evaded and portion of it adds to government revenue The government should also impose a wealth tax on properties of valuation above 50lac or 1crore to end the increasing inequalities Increased amount of taxes on mining of building materials should be done since the illegal miners make lot of illegal money from it Please Capture 80% property, Money, Gold,Silver, Land of All Tempels,MANDIR, MASHJID, GURUDWARA, CHURCH- BCOZ they r Occupy, Capture TRILLION, TRILLION Poor Peoples Propery, Money,-- Examples al gurudwara, Bangla sahib, golden temple, Minakshi mandir, siddhi vinayak, Maximum south Indias mandir, Bengals Kalighat, Iscon, ...

Innumerable temples and heritage ruins are more than 3,00,000 ONLY within India which badly needs documentation, then identification as priority and restoration in stages. Some other Suggestions of GST & INCOME TAX 1) NPS Limit should be increased to 100000 2) GST Rate on automobile should de done on based on CC as thie 75 - 125 CC are not a luxurious ites. The cost of these increased significantly from last two year. we request some provision should be inserted to avoid duplication of this work 5) EWAY LIMIT SHOULD BE INCREASED CENTRALLY ATLEAST TO 150000 and send special guidelines to state to comply with the same 6) Applicability of GST limit increase to atleast 30-35 lakhs 7) Non-Gst supplier guideline should be issued with respect of invoices or any return forms 8) Health Care Budget should be given district wise 9) Oriental, New India and United INSURANCE should be merged Invest in structural reforms as opposed to incremental improvement. We need to think about pockets where problems intersect - like vulnerability, extreme poverty, extreme environmental degradation - and make special investments for these pockets (smaller than blocks) 6. Invest in future - climate resilience, adaptation, green jobs. Dear Sir/Madam, Please consider reducing/removing GST for Sr. Citizen health insurance - Sr. Individuals are generally non-earning and do a living by pension or conventional interest-earning-methods. comming budget,along with other aspect, Agriculture sector must be given one of the top priority as it is essential aspect for rhe livelihood of the people,living in rural area.If the people get sufficient income at their own place e of living,never they would be mobilised to urban area.which is neccessary,so the plan should be such that the rural people must get means of livelihood at their own place. Finally, they are cheating Indian Students and looting Tax payer\\'s money. Most of the said Trusts are either pilling up black money or converting black money into white. If you want to know specific cases, please do contact me confidentially. There are huge amount of Revenue/Tax leakage in this area. Namaskar respected FM and PM, please check to revise income tax slabs to provide relief to taxpayers. At least this can be done for signal jumpers and wrong side commuters. It needs to keep pace with inflation at least. Income up to 20Lakhs per annum should be exempt. Can the Customs department use this data instead of expecting the Companies to generate yet another report? Since last year, the Provident fund contribution was taxed, I would suggest that reduce the mandatory percentage contribution to the tax free amount. That way the salaried folks will be able to pay tax on the balance income and invest for better returns. Hello Ma’am,i want to develop my city by bringing IT companies,colleges,hospital,infrastructure,etc. They can also be advised to deposit some amounts with the government bonds or some such which will give them some interest and/or insurance and so forth. NPS/ELSS contribution limit should increase up to 1Lakh which is 50K now 3. More saving positions should be add to promote savings among middle and lower middle class peoples. What I am getting concerned about is that a few Large Companies advertise, aet-up branches all over India, advertise using popular cine-stars etc., and corner the gold. Based on the cost of living nowadays, please fix the base income slab for Income Tax as 10,00,000. This will eliminate bribery a lot The union budget is required to plan the limited resources for the maximum benefit of the country. If salaried person is paying income tax for continuous x years, Then person should get some benefit in Income tax for next 1 year. Sir, In this generation we have highly qualified people who have the ability to crack any exam. There are people with anxiety who think that, they have no life purpose to live on this earth.

Respected Finance Minister, I would like to bring to your notice two suggestions which you can implement so small investors can get benifit. Please can you plan a scheme that can uplift a person like me who wants to learn in technical field. I have seen people taking certificate courses in PMKVY. In my state there are no factory and industry. Because of that every person look for Government job. To The Honorable. But even after 7 years continuous rule nothing in result for hardships of tax payers/deductors.Income Tax Dept treat Tax payers/Deductors as British Indian subjects.Crores of money hoarding in Co-operative society/Banks- No KYC, multiple account for same person, a/c in the name of deceased persons etc. If you are unable to free, fair,transparent & inclusive taxation please issue shoot at sight order to all tax payers- who are honest- pays for it. Tax slab (income tax) limit shoud be raised upto 7lakh due to high inflation rate in the country. There should be a master plan of housing for all in the union budget. Plan for small industrialists, workers,weavers, daily wagers etc. No sudden benefits or changes in tax allowed for 10 years . To encourage individuals allow waivel up to Rs25000/-. promote inter state marriages..give atleast 5% reservation for their children in central govt jobs.. it will strengthen our unity in diversity. CCTVs in all stations where tickets are checked to eliminate corruption by checkers. Promote digital transactions with more fraud prevention means. Provide clean drinking water to everyone across India at nominal fee. Emphasis on 24X7 electricity to all. Electric automobiles to be promoted, incentivised & charging stations installed. DD NEWS to be 100% Hindi, emphasise on quality improvement, breaking news & LIVE news broadcast, could follow Republic style. Strict regulation on OTT platforms & content. The expenditure figures do not reflect actual expenditure made towards receipt of goods and services. There should be appropriate balance between expenditure and actual implementation. The amounts budgeted are often not realistic. On the other hand, there are major unspent provisions at the end of the year, hence Unrealistic budget estimates should strictly be avoided. Respected Authorities, In order to eradicate illegitimate transaction and curb or limit illegal/black money , i would like to suggest to tax cash withdrawals of more than 2 lakh per month. we need to come up with few advantages or give benefits to tax payers which will there by attract the people of India to pay taxes, also will keep the honest tax payers motivated. we are the backbone of economy, we need support from government sir !

There are cases where Medical Family Members have taken up the challenge and try to cure patient by dropping the medical charges. I would also request Govt to consider the complete donated amount to be exempted from Tax. Incase if any taxpayer dies before 58 year than the nominee should get the benefit of either annuity or lumpsum amount. Namaste , I Have A Suggestion For \"Hindustan Union Budget 2022 To 2023\" Under \"Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav\" , As We Know That There Are Many Poor Children In Our Country Who Are Dreaming To Get Qualification Of \"Education\" .

State/ central run tourist hotels shall allow to sale OTC medicines, sanitary pad and grocery Two & Four wheeler and above wheelers motor vehicles should be charged parking fees if they are parked in public roads .

We need a minimum of 100 crore vaccinations per day (reaching this number was a good achievement - but we should not rest on our laurels - 100 crore per day should be average for country with India\\'s population Let\\'s not repeat the mistakes made during 2nd Delta wave by allowing elections, rallies, cricket matches, Kumbh Mela etc. Salaries were low compared with today\\'s private, corporates or government sector, thus savings.

The per capita consumption of steel has increased in the last five years. Steel is vulnerable to corrosion (the metallic cancerous effect) that limits the life of assets in various public infrastructure and industrial sectors including public water distribution. Corrosion prevention act is very much required to enhance the safety of infrastructure and increase the life of assets before the used assets are subjected for recycling in the steel manufacturing sector.

This may be announced with a minimum investment amount, lock in period of long term between 5 to 10 years, same returns and tax benefits like the NRE Fixed Deposits with the banks.

Infrastructure Budget 2022 is most likely to focus on improving infrastructure. Infrastructure ministries listed under this plan are as follows: The Ministry also mentioned that it has not examined GST-related issues as it falls under the purview of the GST Council. Plans on utilising extra revenue to build more assets shall also be included in Budget 2022. People have been trying to make Budget 2022 predictions ever since. From reducing the tax burden to increasing farmers’ income, tax payers pin their hopes for a great financial year on the Union Budget each year. Regarding my suggestions on budget The government should give more emphasis on the Real estate and Road network Affordable housing and affordable commercial complex for business ( for eg) will welcome or to be more precise will allow small businesses to grow . Roads : Roads are very important for a robust economy . Dear Sir / Mam , I would like to highlight some of the key points which I have observed in the day to day life and it should be consider while adopting the budget allocation for various department . Government should increasing the General coach in train and it should be at least 8 General coaches in the each train .After this pandemic , I have observed due lack number of the seats in the general coaches people are not able to take the ticket from the counter due to that they suffered to do journey without ticket. TDS Hardships and Remedy https://www.linkedin.com/posts/prakasham-up-83412462_accounting-banks-tax-activity-6844561224257163264-MXHz Full blog is given in the above blog. There is a recurring inconvenience and burden for the income tax payers in terms of TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) accounting and corresponding credits in their IT 26AS statements. and RBI must focus in this grey area of banking charges which eats a lots of operation profits as adds to woe of dismal financial stability and ever growing demand for working capital . In macro economics the decision of the government may seem right. instead of imposing taxes on the public, generate ideas to increase government earnings through various means. bring back all black money into our country and develop the country\\'s infrastructure. from committing financial fraud. Separate Education Ministry de-linking it from HRD Ministry. Focus on Export zones, entrepreneurship development and industry friendly policies. Their income sources is the interest on the corpus they hold. Therefore, govt should introduce fd scheme of higher interest rate for retirees thereby standard of living of retirees will improve. New health insurance plan to be introduced which should be cheaper. My suggestions for Union Budget 2022-2023 are as follows:- 1) Please allot 10 percent of total budget for Jal mission. Rest of 25 percent remaining of total budget may be proportionally allotted for other sectors. the foremost focus of the budget is to build the basic infrastructure of our country and promote everyone to take up their own job and provide jobs to the weaker people instead of searching for the job in the market; for this there is a need to make changes in the education policy and promote startups at all levels of the society by providing financial help and other assistance like technical, infrastructure related help through their agencies/NGO\\'s Union budget views are as To make an steps for paying income bracket upto 10% and might be focus on infrastructure bottle necks remove. This is adding more woes and untold miseries to them. other wise we are in trouble. If we have lots of foreign exchange they have an art of extracting this money by selling technological advanced products and armaments. Ours is a big market & everyone is eyeing.Very few countries are interested in ourdevelopment It\\'s our look out to think big produce high value technologically advanced goods with lowest cost. Don\\'t depend on budget it\\'s only a marks card for the previous year. With limited taxes collected Contd--- Sir - here are a few ideas and I m not sure if they are already in the past plan 1) budget for disabled people and special needs kids who are always ignored in school, colleges and Jobs as they need some reserve budget and fixed quota. Please increase term deposit rates and do not subsidise credit. A lot of middle class people depend on term deposits, esp senior citizens and it hits them hard. There is too much discontent over TDS and Advance Tax. Please find a way to save the salaried. The Tax free income should be equal to the maximum pension payable by Central Government so that a retired person (any level) having pension as only source of income is not taxed. Than it becomes applicable to all Indian nationals holding Aadhar Card. Dear Sir, Every time middle class peoples are getting crushed for IT. Respected finance minister, I would like to request you to kindly increase the interest rates of fixed deposits, term deposits as they are the main sources to save money of a lower middle class family. There should be limits on cash in hand. Responsibly we should act immediately. Just think, before keeping cash with you. The amount of cash withdrawal should be justified. Inviting Ideas and Suggestions for Union Budget 2022 - 2023 Interest rates on Fixed Deposits and Saving account balance should be increased of Senior Citizens as they are decreasing day by day. Senior citizens rely on the interest for their livelihood and if that is decreasing it is very hard for them as prices of medicines, and other necessary things are increasing. they collect it in cash only and do not pay tax and this taxable amount is in lakhs. And sometimes we found a wrong person getting benefits due to lethargic government old employees. They are getting worse and they don\\'t have any benifit from government Expenditure Budget - Improve integrity among people by having more number of central government schools in non Hindi speaking states. If we could have started this in the year 1947 by this time cohesiveness would have been there among people. After few years every child will speak Hindi and national integrity will improve. tax payers must get proper medical and health realted facilities besides BPL families. Every businessman must pay tax and there should be separate tax slab for them as per their earnings and profits. Minimum saving amount should be raised from Rs.1,50,000 to Rs.300000/- per annum. For speeding of Export customs clearance, just as an airport passenger terminal, export cargo at carting points should be scanned by each CFS. S/bills be assessed automatically, cargo scanning should be mandatory with adequate number of scanners at each CFS. Only \"Doubtful\" export cargo should be put on hold for further inspection at CFS. But emphasis has to be given RMS assessment & improvising on vigilance, 100% container scanning at all major port terminals. JNPT handles approx 30 lac containers each year, scanning capacity is hardly 20% presently. With RMS assessment Faceless import assessment can be minimised, burden on FAG can be reduced with improving back up of container scanning at terminals. Container scanning is done by customs at terminal Gates at each port terminals for containerized cargo but capacity of installations of high speed scanners need to be added. Please do not add further tax burden on genuine tax payers, every year taxation is increased in one way or another for these individuals. It is understandable that govt has put lot of efforts in the past to extract money from corrupt & reduce unnecessary expenditure and they did not provide desired outcome. We need to re-look how we can solve these problems like tax evasion(both at an individual & business level) in a smart way and invite folks from all areas to solve this menace. This should a singular focus for Finance Ministry in the upcoming years. We need to innovate on next gen advancements in Technology & Medicine and build home grown solutions. This is one of the reason why western countries grew a lot. expertise but we are not channelising our resources and still relying on importing this tech from France. Such investments create jobs for both niche professionals (tackling brain drain problem) and blue collar market. Increase expenditure in public health infrastructure. Current early taxation policy puts a lot of financial burden on individuals and many end up not taking it\\'s full benefits or suffer huge losses as well. And tools like ESOPs, RSUs provide a much needed cushion. Increase in assets beyond threshold limit say 5 lakhs should attract tax. It should not be more then 20 lakh. All India freedom fighter pension scheme Government should focus on building more specialized hospitals and recycle of plastics. Please allow accredited Money changers to make current account remittances on behalf of MSME / service industry for at least smaller amounts upto USD 10,000. • High penalty and seizing of Assets for Tax Evasion. TRY TO MERGE OLD AGE & ORPHANS HOUSE OR ANY KIND OF HUMAN CELL ,SO THAT THEY CAN ENJOY THEIR COMPANY AND CULTURE TOO. It\\'s about Delhi pollution. There is a condition of temperature inversion, when ground becomes more cooler. Temperature inversion means, when we go up temperature increases due to which pollutant air remains on ground level. In general condition temperature decreases as we go up. 3) means all vehicle should stop before evening then restrict sell of alcohol. 5)women safety wish you a happy new year 2022 and safe life in Delhi. Lot of people are yet to buys their first home. This would promote local brands and helps the poor consumer as goods are comparatively affordable. 100/- slippers are 150/- now.. Govt should nullify the GST on non-branded goods under 500/- That would make 90% of poor persons consumption bucket. Because even the Agarabatti are getting costly stating the reason of GST.. Sleeping Beauty, Nirmala Sitaraman has caused more damage to the Govt\\'s reputation than the Mamta Banerjee. Her ignorance will hurt the Govt a lot and Govt has to really work hard to do the damage control here. People are losing jobs faster than they are getting created. In the same way, Al Jazeera, an Islamic Channel conveniently excluding worse performing Iranian, Turkish and Pakistani currencies, ran fabricated news that Indian Rupee is worst performing currency in Asia. All the channel picked up this news bashing Finance Ministry.. kindly cancel the gregorian calendar, as national official calendar which is adopted by then p m nehru on 22 mar 1957, Allthough suggested by national council for panchang and industrial committee in 1955.The hindu panchang based on Vikram shaka is the correct and suitable for Indians. In the same way, Al Jazeera, an Islamic Channel ran fabricated news that Indian Rupee is worst performing currency in Asia. All the channel picked up this news bashing Finance Ministery.. Sir Please allocate more budget, i.e., double the allocation in Health and Education sector. Increase pention allocation for people having EPF accounts. For Education sector: There should be free and compulsory education for all on all government school upto 10th standard ( free for one child only per family). And For Business Sector: If anyone found who have not paid tax or with tax evasion or found with black income then saized their 90% of total property and all money.

Sir with respect i say that my father is a Pensioner having his Bank A/c no 33406847929 with SBI Krishnanagar Branch Bhavnagar in which he gets his Pension Credited every month. Sir i respectfully say that there should be the Mechanism where the Pensioners get their Pension Credited in their Bank A/cs. Hence it is respectfully requested to do the needful. I request the Government to focus much more on scheme relating to diversification of crops especially in Punjab and Haryana region as well as focus on more ecology to make lives much more sustainable and revive rivers back to its original glory UNSCRUPLOUS ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIETY AGAIN AND AGAIN TROUBLING MY FAMILY MEMBERS. THEY ARE TRYING TO EXTORT MONEY BY BLACKMAILING. I KINDLY REQUEST YOU TO ENGAGE CBI TO INVESTIGATE THE MATTER & STRICTLY PUNISH THE CONVICTS. Education is the backbone of development of an economy, From 2022 government should focus on all round development of Education and health. Another important reason is people also more protective conscious if they are in their own state .it also ensures our nation\\'s safety. So create it in this union budget. No income tax and gst provision for transgender. 2) Allow atal pension Yojana age up to 50 years currently it is eligible for 18-40 years with increase premium. budget should consider, for employees as whatever they earn pay tax on it. Due to rising prices and low band people are not in position to express there feelings. I urge government to think over this matter. Please ignore this message and need not taken it to be serious. Here thinking of skilled and unskilled labours is also necessary.'"
